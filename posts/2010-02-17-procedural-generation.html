<p>Working as a small development studio, often in small teams with limited
resources, you start looking at alternative ways to do things. Large development
studios can spend millions of dollars on top-notch designers to get state of the
art graphics. But as we all know, on a small salary working as a freelance
programmer I can't just go the bank and state: I have this brilliant concept,
please front me a few million because the graphics have to be brilliant.</p>

<p>Working a day job even time is a limited resource, designing all graphics
yourself or even when you find artists willing to put in the time, is almost
not feasible. But when you have the stamina and determinism you would probably
have to rewrite your code and graphics for the next quantum computer. Since
that will be the standard when you finish your product.</p>

<h2>There are more roads to Rome</h2>

<p>I often find myself conflicted while brainstorming on projects, on the one hand
you have the conceptual world in which everything is possible. On the other side you
have the real world, and with this real world comes various challenges.</p>

<p>Once you find a way to overcome, or work around the various challenges,
you have a shot at realising your concept. One tool to overcome the practical
challenges of content is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedural generation</a>.</p>

<h2>Let's dive in with .kkrieger</h2>

<object style="float:right" width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1VqzjafwCNA&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1VqzjafwCNA&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>


<p>Before studying the process of procedural generation in some more detail let's
look at what is done at this moment. A brilliant example of procedural
generation arose from the demo-scene.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VqzjafwCNA">.kkrieger</a> A proof that almost all
content is generated is the size of the game. All content is packed in 96Kb! The
way the developers achieved this is is by basing all the elements on basic
solids, such as boxes and cylinders with a function to deform them. Textures are
stored using creation history thus only having to store the pixmap and the
functions to manipulate them to get the end result. This way they could pack
300Mb worth of textures and data in a sheer 97,280 bytes of disk space.</p>

<h2>Was this done before?</h2>

<p>A few of the first games ever developed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Mirco</a> (16Kb ram)
where confronted with severe space constraints. This poses some serious real
world challenges on what is possible. One has to be very inventive to be able
to produce an interesting game. The earliest computers where severely limited by
memory constraints. This made it impossible to store everything, level
information, artwork, there was only room for a few elements.</p>

<h3>Elite, the open ended space trader game</h3>

<p>An interesting example of a game I really loved is Elite, the creators designed
a formula to store 2<sup>48</sup> (282 trillion) galaxies with 256 solar systems each.
The solar systems had their own political systems, the trading prices, even the
names of the planets where generated. They limited the final game to only 8
universes. The are many more examples of "old-school" games which used this
technique. Often based upon a seeded Pseudo Random number generator used to feed
the generation functions.</p>

<h3>Exile, the cavern explorer game</h3>

<p>Another Magnum Opus of programming which conquered serious technical challenge is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(video_game_series">Exile</a>), I found <a href="http://exile.acornarcade.com/devel.html">an interesting read</a>
giving some interesting quotes from the developers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Technical issues aside, and against all modern business rules, the Exile game
itself was allowed to evolve from little more than having a spaceman exploring
a cavern system. We didn't know where it was going in the early stages and
really just thought about new experiences for the hero and new technical
features (like line of sight vision for inhabitants) as we went. Personally I
believe that the best creations occur if allowed to develop at least partly in
this evolutionary way rather than completely designed from scratch at the
outset. It takes much longer of course to produce something this way and you
are in danger of never finishing if you lose sight of the goal, but is worth
it in the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notice the evolutionary process. Planning in detail ahead is a killer for any form of
creativity.</p>

<p>The amount of innovating techniques and content creation used in programming
the gameplay of Exile is stunning. Think only about the map in Exile, another
quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>The huge map of Exile was generated by an algorithm which from an input of the
xy map coordinates created tunnels, solid rock, or one of the few special
blocks that could have manually defined objects in them, like creatures,
doors, guns, etc. It took a long time to fiddle with this algorithm to produce
a tunnel system that was all linked up and interesting, but the storage
required for it was actually tiny.</p></blockquote>

<p>To see the world which they generated procedurally: <a href="http://c64.tin.at/exile/exile_map.sol.htm">Exile's complete map</a></p>

<h2>The ideal world</h2>

<p>Imagine a completely generated game world, where even the creatures you interact
with are generated. Their intelligence adapts to the way you play the game. Keeping the difficulty
at your level. The AI is finding your weak spots and is trying to exploit them. You have to adapt to
a world that is adapting to you and challenging you. All you see is generated on the fly. No element of
the game is designed by an artist. Any ideas?</p>
